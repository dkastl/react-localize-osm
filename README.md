# OpenStreetMap Localisation Tool

[![Status](https://github.com/tracestrack/openstreetmap-localization-web/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tracestrack/openstreetmap-localization-web/actions)

## What is it?

This project aims to facilitate name localization in OpenStreetMap. 

All that is needed is to log in your OSM account, then zoom in to your hometown 
or somewhere else, load the list of names in this area and start bringing 
the names of your familiar places to other languages.
